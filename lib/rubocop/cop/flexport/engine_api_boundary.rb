module RuboCop
  module Cop
    module Flexport
      # This cop prevents code outside of a Rails Engine from directly
      # accessing the engine without going through an API. The goal is
      # to improve modularity and enforce separation of concerns.
      #
      # # Defining an engine's API
      #
      # The cop looks inside an engine's `api/` directory to determine its
      # API. API surface can be defined in two ways:
      #
      # - Add source files to `api/`. Code defined in these modules
      #   will be accessible outside your engine. For example, adding
      #   `api/foo_service.rb` will allow code outside your engine to
      #   invoke eg `MyEngine::Api::FooService.bar(baz)`.
      # - Create a `_whitelist.rb` file in `api/`. Modules listed in
      #   this file are accessible to code outside the engine. The file
      #   must have this name and a particular format (see below).
      #
      # Both of these approaches can be used concurrently in the same engine.
      # Due to Rails Engine directory conventions, the API directory should
      # generally be located at eg `engines/my_engine/app/api/my_engine/api/`.
      #
      # # Usage
      #
      # This cop can be useful when splitting apart a legacy codebase.
      # In particular, you might move some code into an engine without
      # enabling the cop, and then enable the cop to see where the engine
      # boundary is crossed. For each violation, you can either:
      #
      # - Expose new API surface from your engine
      # - Move the violating file into the engine
      # - Add the violating file to `_legacy_dependents.rb` (see below)
      #
      # The cop detects cross-engine associations as well as cross-engine
      # module access.
      #
      # # Isolation guarantee
      #
      # This cop can be easily circumvented with metaprogramming, so it cannot
      # strongly guarantee the isolation of engines. But it can serve as
      # a useful guardrail during development, especially during incremental
      # migrations.
      #
      # Consider using plain-old Ruby objects instead of ActiveRecords as the
      # exchange value between engines. If one engine gets a reference to an
      # ActiveRecord object for a model in another engine, it will be able
      # to perform arbitrary reads and writes via associations and `.save`.
      #
      # # Example `api/_legacy_dependents.rb` file
      #
      # This file contains a burn-down list of source code files that still
      # do direct access to an engine "under the hood", without using the
      # API. It must have this structure.
      #
      # ```rb
      # module MyEngine::Api::LegacyDependents
      #   FILES_WITH_DIRECT_ACCESS = [
      #     "app/models/some_old_legacy_model.rb",
      #     "engines/other_engine/app/services/other_engine/other_service.rb",
      #   ]
      # end
      # ```
      #
      # # Example `api/_whitelist.rb` file
      #
      # This file contains a list of modules that are allowed to be accessed
      # by code outside the engine. It must have this structure.
      #
      # ```rb
      # module MyEngine::Api::Whitelist
      #   PUBLIC_MODULES = [
      #     MyEngine::BarService,
      #     MyEngine::BazService,
      #     MyEngine::BatConstants,
      #   ]
      # end
      # ```
      #
      # @example
      #
      #   # bad
      #   class MyService
      #     m = ReallyImportantSharedEngine::InternalModel.find(123)
      #     m.destroy

      #     ReallyImportantSharedEngine::Api::SomeService.execute(123)
      #   end
      #
      # @example
      #
